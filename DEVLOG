Biraj - 1/4/20
  - Trying to connect multiple computers, but running into errors while creating the fork
  - Sometimes forking also gives us an error

Leo - 1/4/20
  - Seg faults trying to read and break down audio file
  - threading audio file and identifying parts will be difficult

Alex - 1/5/20
  - Researching networking and attempting it on a very basic level
  - creating a client is giving me a seg fault.

Leo - 1/7/20
  - Creating multiple audio files when trying to parse the one is messing up the program.
  - Trying to use wav.h with the audio files

Biraj - 1/8/20
  - Figrued out how to connect multiple computers.
  - can display something on each, but in a limited way
  - not sure how to get the files to each comptuer to play

Alex and Leo - 1/9/20
  - Trying to figure out a way that we can run a file on each computer
  - Need a way for us to play each file
  - thinking about basic user interface

Leo - 1/12/20
  - Found Jukehost for us to use
  - Basically we can launch it from it's link with each file in the code
  - This will make it much easier to facilitate interaction
  - We simply have to get the file to the other machines

Biraj - 1/13/20
  - Probably not going to be able to implement splitting of audio files
  - ran into too many seg faults and complications trying to just get through the file
  - actually identifying frequencies and properties of each sound would have been too ambitious

Alex - 1/15/20
  - We are now able to launch the browser from the other computers
  - Still unable to actually get the file there
  - File appears but there is nothing in it

Leo - 1/16/20
  - Not going to split the audio files
  - Produced a drum beat using computer software
  - each instrument has been split into its own mp3 file and uploaded to JukeHost

Biraj - 1/17/20
  - God bless the extension. Truly amazing.
  - We are in a good place to finish by the new deadline
  - Sending files to other systems is now possible.
  - still not working with the application though

Biraj - 1/18/20
  - Multi-client networking implemented 
  - Server can send the command we need to 2 clients
  - Makefile is now more sophisticated

Leo - 1/19/20
  - Trying to send different things to each client
  - Global variable unchanging
  - Fixed bugs with select client

Team (Met Up) - 1/19/20
  - Now realizing we do need shared memory to get it to work
  - Everything runs, but clients do not receive different info

Team (Discord Call) - 1/20/20
  - The shared memory first gave us File Exists Error #17 so we made a file to counteract that that we run every time.
  - We still cannot get each client to play a different audio file.
  - Dealing with issues because of the need to ssh into school computers
  - Unfortunately, it became clear that we would not be able to finish
  - The shared memory appears to work, but refuses to change

Leo - 1/21/20
  - First client gets the right information, but then the server behaves incorrectly for additional clients 
  - Will request an extension

Team (Met Up) - 1/21/20
  - Continued trying to implement shared memory
  - Discovered existence of subserver_count, which is what we were trying to implement/produce
  - Adjusted use of shared memory
  - Each client now gets the right information
