Biraj - 1/4/20
  - Trying to connect multiple computers, but running into errors while creating the fork
  - Sometimes forking also gives us an error

Leo - 1/4/20
  - Seg faults trying to read and break down audio file
  - threading audio file and identifying parts will be difficult

Alex - 1/5/20
  - Researching networking and attempting it on a very basic level
  - creating a client is giving me a seg fault.

Leo - 1/7/20
  - Creating multiple audio files when trying to parse the one is messing up the program.
  - Trying to use wav.h with the audio files

Biraj - 1/8/20
  - Figrued out how to connect multiple computers.
  - can display something on each, but in a limited way
  - not sure how to get the files to each comptuer to play

Alex and Leo - 1/9/20
  - Trying to figure out a way that we can run a file on each computer
  - Need a way for us to play each file
  - thinking about basic user interface

Leo - 1/12/20
  - Found Jukehost for us to use
  - Basically we can launch it from it's link with each file in the code
  - This will make it much easier to facilitate interaction
  - We simply have to get the file to the other machines

Biraj - 1/13/20
  - Probably not going to be able to implement splitting of audio files
  - ran into too many seg faults and complications trying to just get through the file
  - actually identifying frequencies and properties of each sound would have been too ambitious

Alex - 1/15/20
  - We are now able to launch the browser from the other computers
  - Still unable to actually get the file there
  - File appears but there is nothing in it

Leo - 1/16/20
  - Not going to split the audio files
  - Produced a drum beat using computer software
  - each instrument has been split into its own mp3 file and uploaded to JukeHost

Biraj - 1/17/20
  - God bless the extension. Truly amazing.
  - We are in a good place to finish by the new deadline
  - Sending files to other systems is now possible.
  - still not working with the application though
