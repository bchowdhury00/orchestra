# Drum Orchestra

Biraj Chowdhury (5th), Leo Shestakov (10th), Alex Thompson (10th)

We utilized network programming to create a server that acts as a conductor and instructs separate clients to play separate instruments (in sync) as part of a composition/orchestra. The "instruments" are individual drum samples that form a beat. There are 5 (max) possible instruments/clients.

We originally intended to be able to split a single audio (or midi) file, but determined that it was an unlikely goal. Instead, we are using files uploaded to JukeHost to play individually uploaded mp3 files (of separate instruments) through the default browser.

There are no required libraries for this project.
